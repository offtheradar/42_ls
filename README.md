# 42_ls

This is my implementation of the famous terminal function "ls". The following flags are available:
 -l   List in long format.  (See below.)  If the output is to a
             terminal, a total sum for all the file sizes is output on a line before the long listing.
 -R   Recursively list subdirectories encountered.
 -a   Include directory entries whose names begin with a dot (.).
 -r   Reverse the order of the sort to get reverse lexicographical order or the oldest entries
             first (or largest files last, if combined with sort by size
 -t   Sort by time modified (most recently modified first) before sorting the operands by lexico-
             graphical order.
